### ManyToMany Test Application

- This application was built using "Clean Architecture" guidelines and a domain-centric approach to focus on business requirements and to achieve maintenance, modularity, separation of concerns, and extensibility in the future.
  
- I selected the MVI architecture pattern to have a defined state of the screen at each moment and to have a strongly determined way to handle user interaction.
- I chose Jetpack Compose for UI, and Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous work
